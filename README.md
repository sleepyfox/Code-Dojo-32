Code Dojo 32
============
This is my worked example from the 32nd meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with it. I've used Node.js and Ki with the Mocha testing library and the Chai assertion library.

The tests can be run from the command-line with:
	
	npm test

The source of the kata is the Diamond Kata, put simply:

	Given a letter, print a diamond starting with ‘A’ with the supplied letter at the widest point.

	For example: print-diamond ‘C’ prints:

	  A
	 B B
	C   C
	 B B
	  A

The earliest mention I could find of it was [here](http://claysnow.co.uk/recycling-tests-in-tdd/)
